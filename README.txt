The aim is to move from a list of URLs (the Moodle IFCELS pages) to a complete html code for a block.
The moodle_html_parser.py provides pairs of coursename:url
The next step is to insert that information into the navigation_block.html automatically,
possibly using id="English Language skills A1...", and maybe regex to avoid the year declaration.
