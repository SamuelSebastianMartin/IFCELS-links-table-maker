Make csv of regex/coursenames for all courses, like 'elas_regex_names.csv'.
The regex must identify the course uniquely from the long names on Moodle.
The coursename will be the name that appears in the finished table (eg 'QM').
The regex column must not have quotation marks of any kind.

Make a function to force term1 courses into coulumn1, and term2: column2 etc.
This should not fail when the term/block value is 'None'.

Make the program universal by replacing 'elas' with some variabel that can
take 'elas', 'icc' etc. This will be for the filename when writing the block,
opening the 'regex_coursename_ .csv' etc - anywhere where 'elas' now appears
in the code. Also, the 'Title' of the table will need to change with the
module.

Should this be a class?
